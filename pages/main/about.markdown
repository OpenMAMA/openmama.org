Advisory Group
-----------------------------

Role of the OpenMAMA Software Maintainer
----------------------------------------

As in most open source projects, OpenMAMA will have a dedicated source code maintainer who, as the delegated authority,
reviews changes that are submitted by contributors, provides feedback to the developers, and accepts community
contributions where appropriate.

Responsibilities of the OpenMAMA Software Maintainer include:

* Approve and develop roadmap based on suggestions from the Steering Committee
* Work with the technical team to drive the technical direction of the OpenMAMA project
* Scheduling work efforts based on prioritization of the Steering Committee and the needs of the project

* Working closely with technical team developing the source code
* Working closely with QA team testing the source code
* Dealing with reported bugs in a timely manner
* Preparing binaries - packages of the source code

OpenMAMA Working Groups
-----------------------

These ad hoc groups define and document the various requirements for the OpenMAMA Project, which are formed around the
strongest needs for the Project's users. The Technical Group take these requirements and work with the Maintainer to
develop plans for execution.

OpenMAMA Supporter 
-------------------

There is also the concept of an OpenMAMA supporter, this is a firm who supports / has adopted OpenMAMA in their products
or services and may or may not contribute to the community collaborative projects.
